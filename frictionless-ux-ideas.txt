🚀 FRICTIONLESS EXPENSE INPUT IDEAS
====================================

1. Inline Table Editing
   - Click any cell → edit in place, no popups
   - Eyes never leave the table

2. Smart Autocomplete
   - Type "st..." → suggests "Starbucks coffee - £4.50 - Food"
   - Learns from your history of created expenses
   - The more the user uses the app, the smarter it gets

3. Bulk Paste Parser ⭐
   Example:
   Paste unstructured text:
   "bought coffee 4.50
   uber home 12
   tesco shopping 45.67"
   Make it show the output as user types it in for immediate feedback (one-by-one, not all at end)

4. Voice Dump Mode ⭐
   - Speak continuously for 1-2 minutes
   - "I bought coffee 4.50, uber was 12, tesco 45.67..."
   - AI parses into multiple expenses
   - Preview table (green highlights like agent mode vscode)
   - Edit/delete bad parses before confirming
   - One click → creates all expenses
   - Same review flow works for paste (idea #4)
   
   → Auto-creates 3 expenses
   → AI suggests categories
   → Review/confirm in one click. nice
   
   - Dump everything at once
   - Parse multiple expenses from messy text
   - Perfect for end-of-day batch entry

5. Smart Bank Statement Paste
   - Paste from bank app → auto-detects date/amount/merchant
   - Instant bulk import

6. Excel/CSV Import
   - Upload spreadsheet with expenses
   - Handles bank exports with junk prefixes (POS, DEBIT)

7. Screenshot Receipt Scanner ⭐
   - Take photo or paste receipt screenshot
   - OCR extracts merchant, amount, date
   - Preview → user confirms/edits
   - Perfect for expense reports

8. Default the expense date to today and don’t show a date picker in Quick Add. If the user types or says a date (“yesterday”, “12 Feb”), override it automatically.
