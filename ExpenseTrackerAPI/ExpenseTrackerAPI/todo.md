📝 Note:
Use ng bootstrap docs for styling: https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home

🚀 Work on next: 
❌ authentication (login, signup)
❌ authorisation (only show admin dashboard if IsAdmin = 1)


📋 TO DO:
❌ fix notifications bug 
❌ if no values changed in update, dont send api call. show notif nothing changed
❌ Add pagination
❌ for update expense, can have an undo button to revert changes.
❌ Add notification toast messages for successfully adding, updating, and deleting expenses
❌ add end of week/month recaps
❌ add user settings where they can choose custom emojis for categories, revert confirmation popup settings
❌ add authetnciation, login, signup etc
❌ export to pdf/excel
❌ powerbi dashboard style ui 

💡 Development Ideas:
❌ Use azure devops free tier and use azure devops MCP to create stories for all of below on my personal account

✨ Cool features to implement:
❌ Add a category called "Subscription" for recurring payments. Create a screen where user can see all subscriptions displayed with a cool visualisation. Each subscription is a rectangle, the bigger the rectangle, the more expensive the subscription.
❌ Smart categorisation
❌ Monthly budget + warnings
❌ Recurring expenses detection
❌ Frictionless input. Inline quick add -> £12.50 coffee -> parses into amount + category + name. Massively reduces friction
❌ "Where did my money go?" . Biggest category this month. Biggest increase vs last month. Top 3 merchants.
❌ Month to month comparison. % increase/decrease per category. 
❌ Spending anomalies. Unusually large transactions. Unusual category spend.
❌ Financial health score. Score based on budget adherence, savings rate, expense volatility. Explain why the score changed. 
❌ Regret tagging. User mark expense as thumbs up (worth it), neutral (meh face), thumbs down (regret). Over time, show stats on regret vs non-regret purchases.
You regretted 5 purchases at Pret last month (£38).
❌ "Invisible money" view. Small-recurring expenses. Sub-£5 purchases. You spent £127 on purchases under £5. Insightful and surprising
❌ Voice input for adding expenses. Can do lots in one go.
❌ Reports -> export as pdf, excel etc. Date-locked summaries. 
❌ Financial seasons -> Let users label months as "Holiday season", "Wedding season". Insights become fairer and smarter
❌ Attach notes to months -> "Moved house" "Started new job". When revisiting old data, context helps understand spending

✅ DONE:
✅ Create CRUD Operations on backend
✅ add admin UI and separate endpoint and separate admin expense dto potentially
✅ Create shared components folder 
✅ Allow CRUD Operations on frontend
✅ Utilise DTOs instead of domain objects in endpoints, e.g. CreateExpenseDto, UpdateExpenseDto
✅ use automapper
✅ add created at date for ex.Expenses
✅ rename components to use angular19+ version (e.g. remove .component. from home.component.html)
