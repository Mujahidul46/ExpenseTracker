TO DO:
- Create CRUD Operations
- Utilise DTOs instead of domain objects in endpoints, e.g. CreateExpenseDto, UpdateExpenseDto
- Add pagination

Cool features to implement:
- Add a category called "Subscription" for recurring payments. Create a screen where user can see all subscriptions displayed with a cool visualisation. Each subscription is a rectangle, the bigger the rectangle, the more expensive the subscription.
- add admin UI and separate endpoint and separate admin expense dto potentially


DONE:
